### PREvent
Mingyu Zhang, Jay Feng, Joseph Wu, William Hwang

### Background & Motivation
* Most (~50-60%) health problems originate from a person's local environment (home, office, etc)
* Current health care system is poorly equipped to deal with issues outside the hospital or clinic
* Many issues with the local environment are simple to identify, straight forward to address
* Problem is, the local environment is generally not addressed in the health system

### Concept
* Wear a few extra uncommon environmental sensors on the wrist or belt
* Collect sensor data + GPS
* Alert user upon spikes in local risk factors
* Build maps of temporal and spatial risk factors around the user's location and paths

### Example Scenarios
* Ventilation filters to your office wear down and start spewing unclean air
    * You find out right away
    * Otherwise, a routine maintenance make take several weeks/months to fix the problem
* Cyclotron in nearby UW medical center malfunctions and bathes campus in gamma rays

### Competing Products
* Speck
Home-based PM2.5 sensor
* SensorDrone
Peripheral sensor expansion for phone
* Sensaris
No data since 2013

### Resources Needed
* Dust/large particulate matter sensor
* CO sensor
* UV sensor
* Radiation sensor
* Small particulate matter (PM10 & PM2.5) sensor
* Gaseous alcohol (i.e. breathalyzer) sensor
* Humidity sensor
